</head> <!-- </head> defines the ending of <head> which means everything after his will show in the website. -->

<body> <!-- We dont really need to use <body> but to make the website more clearly outlined we can use it. -->
  
<h1>My example website</h1> <!-- using <h1> gives me a section heading -->
  
<h3>Using h and then a number gives me a heading, with h1 being the biggest and h6 the smallest.</h3> 
  
<u>I can use different tags to use different fonts, look on itslearning for more..</u>
<br> <br> 

<p>Using the tag above, "br", gives me space (or a break in line) between the different text. The more you have, the bigger space you get.  </p>
<br> 

<p> Inserting images, videos and hyperlinks is also possible. To use images or videos i have to either load up the file on replit, one the left side, or use the hyperlink to the video/image. </p>

<p>Example of video inserted:</p>
<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VghP4qaxxk8" title="Bananer i Pyjamas norsk intro" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>To do this i just go to the youtube-video i want to insert, right click and choose copy youtube embed or something like that. Then copy that and insert into the HTML code. Remember to change width, height, etc. </p>
